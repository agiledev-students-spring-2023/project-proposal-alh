# Project Proposal(College Collabs): 


### Project title

College Collabs

### What and why?


A common problem that many college students face is not knowing anyone in their classes. Often times, as a college student, many of your friends either aren't in your major or have different flexibility with class scheduling, ultimately making it difficult to be in the same classes as each other. Furthermore, in many courses, the bulk of the class time is taken up by a lecture, which leaves little to no time to meet any of the peers around you. Thus, College Collabs will be a web app that aims to help college students find fellow peers in their classes, and faciliate more meaningful collaboration and group studying. Promoting more collaboration outside the classroom is beneficial for students, as having more people to study/discuss ideas will often make it easier to learn a new concept. 



### For whom?


This software will be for college students taking courses where collaboration outside the classroom is mutually beneficial for everyone. 



### How?



Upon registering for the app, the user will go through a series of questions to create their profile:\
\
        1. Which college/university do you attend? \
        2. What type of learner are you? \
        3. What times throughout the day are you most efficient with your learning/studying? \
        4. What times throughout the day are you usually working on homework? 


After creating their profile, the user should be prompted to enter the courses they are taking, and which professors they have. Then, the system should match the user to other users who are taking the same courses and have similar study habits, and users will be able to start a 1-on-1 chat with any other users they are matched with. 

### Scope

First, building out the visual aspects of the frontend shouldn't require anyone in the group to need a lot of expertise in React/HTML/CSS, but adding the different functionalities such as the student matching system and 1-on-1 chats will provide an adequate challenge for everyone in the group. In addition, there will need to be a database established for storing user's information in a secure manner. For 4-6 programmers who don't have a lot of previous experience developing a full stack app from front to back, this software can be completed in one semester, including the time needed to learn the different parts of the MERN stack.
